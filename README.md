# Workout-Manager

My goal for this project is to make a UI for Workout Manager. I'm professional runner and I would like to have my workouts grouped in a way it's suitable for me. 

So far it uses python implementation for downloading data form polar accesslink server, parse it and converts to objects which are simple to manipulate with.

I want to add features like grouping by date or type of workout. Representing trainings in calendar and also ability to convert it to PDF and send it via email to your coach.
